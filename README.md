## Problem Statement:

1.	A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You’ve been asked to program the new system. You are to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats). <br>
Your program should display the following menu of alternatives—Please type 1 for "First Class" and Please type 2 for "Economy". If the person types 1, your program should assign a seat in the first class section (seats 1– 5).If the person types 2, your program should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6–10). Your program should print a boarding pass indicating the person’s seat number and whether it’s in the first class or economy section of the plane.<br> 
Your program should, of course, never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the first class section is full, your program should ask the person if it’s acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice versa).If yes, then make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves in 3 hours."<br>

      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
